# 🎵 Emotion Recognition–Based Music Recommendation System
A real-time computer vision application that detects human emotions from facial expressions using deep learning and recommends music playlists accordingly. The project includes both a web-based Streamlit app and a local OpenCV + Spotify prototype.
# Project Overview
This system captures live webcam input, detects faces, predicts emotions using a fine-tuned CNN model, and recommends music based on the detected emotion. It demonstrates the complete ML lifecycle: data preprocessing, transfer learning, fine-tuning, evaluation, and deployment.
